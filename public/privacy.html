            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This service operates as a web proxy using Ultraviolet technology. We prioritize user privacy and aim to be transparent about our operations. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our service.</p>

            <h2>How the Service Works</h2>
            <p>Our service functions as a client-side proxy, meaning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All page processing happens in your browser</li>
                <li>Content is fetched through a third-party bare server (not operated by us)</li>
                <li>Scripts and resources are rewritten in real-time</li>
                <li>Service workers handle request interception</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Third-Party Bare Server</h2>
            <p>Important: This service relies on an external bare server that we do not own or operate. Please note:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The bare server is operated by independent third parties</li>
                <li>We have no control over the bare server's operations or policies</li>
                <li>Any data processing at the bare server level is not our responsibility</li>
                <li>The bare server's availability and performance are beyond our control</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data Collection and Analytics</h2>
            <p>We collect and process the following types of data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Through the third-party bare server:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Requested URLs (for proxying purposes only)</li>
                        <li>Necessary headers to maintain connections</li>
                        <li>Temporary data required for proxy functionality</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Through analytics services:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Google Analytics: Collects anonymous usage data including page views, session duration, and basic device information</li>
                        <li>TelemetryDeck: Gathers anonymous metrics about service performance and feature usage</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Important: We do not control how the bare server processes this data. Any data handling at the bare server level is subject to their policies and practices.</p>

            <h2>Cookies and Tracking</h2>
            <p>Our service uses the following types of cookies and tracking technologies:</p>

            </ul>
